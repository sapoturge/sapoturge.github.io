Sapoturge
=========

### John Hiatt

I am a software developer. I have experience in Python, Rust, C, C++, C#, Java, ARM Assembly,
Haskell, Lisp, Vala, and several other languages. I tend to make things that are useful to other
programmers (and myself).

## Projects

* [![Froggum icon](/assets/images/froggum-small.svg) **Froggum**](/froggum)

    **Froggum** is an SVG editor written for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io). I have been
    working on it since June 2020, and am getting close to releasing version 0.3.

    *(Note: the master branch of the repository contains **Froggum 0.2**, the last stable release.
    **Froggum 0.3** lives in it's own branch and the development branches. It will be merged into
    the master branch when I'm ready to release it officially.)*

* [SwiftLibUSB](https://github.com/SwiftVISA/SwiftLibUSB)

    SwiftLibUSB is a Swift package implementing the VISA protocol for USB devices. I implemented it
    as part of a group project while at the Colorado School of Mines.
