During the last four years of **Froggum**'s development, there have been several pauses. Some were
due to school or other responsibilities taking priority, some were due to 
[ambiguous specifications](/2024/01/15/handles-redesign.html), and some were due to really annoying
bugs.

The latest development-stopping bug was a simple one: all info bars appear dull yellow.

This seems to happen because I'm on Windows, which does not have the same default Gtk stylesheet as
elementary OS, where **Froggum** is intended to be used. 

For the error bar to look like an error, it is reasonably important for it to be red. The next (and
last) major feature will also have an info bar, which needs to be a different color. Therefore, all
info bars being the same color is a problem.

I tried to fix this a few ways. There is a MinGW package
[`gtk-elementary-theme`](https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-gtk-elementary-theme), which I
installed.  This had no effect. I installed
[`elementary/stylesheet`](https://github.com/elementary/stylesheet) from source. This had no
effect. I tried writing custom CSS. This had an effect, but it didn't look good, and wouldn't look
good on elementary either.

This is where development paused, because I had no idea what to do about this, but it needed to be
fixed.

## The Solution

Today, I decided to get back to working on **Froggum** by searching "gtk4 set default theme" on
Google. This led me to a
[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1dmzi1w/how_to_use_gtk_4_themes/)
which, among other suggestions, included the line `export GTK_THEME=Your-Theme-Name`.

I tried it.

```
$ export GTK_THEME=io.elementary.stylesheet.lime
$ io.github.sapoturge.froggum
```

It worked.

Since this isn't a code change, I can't make it work for everyone automatically. I will put it in
the documentation that I need to start writing. I also seem to need the icon theme.

The important part is that I can now continue working on **Froggum** without this bug hanging over
me.

## Conclusion

In order for the error bar to look correct on Windows, you need to install and use the elementary
stylesheet.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/elementary/stylesheet
$ cd stylesheet
$ meson setup build
$ cd build
$ ninja install
$ export GTK_THEME=io.elementary.stylesheet.lime
```

elementary has several theme colors; lime may be switched for any other (options include banana,
blueberry, bubblegum, cocoa, grape, latte, lime, mint, orange, slate, strawberry, and dark variants
of each base color).

On elementary itself, the system theme should be used automatically, so none of this should matter.
